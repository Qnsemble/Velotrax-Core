# Velotrax-Core OS Baseline (Phase 2 Readiness)

This OS-only update prepares the orchestration layer for distributed quantum runs.

## Objectives
- Establish OS-level orchestration for quantum simulation modules.
- Maintain interoperability with governance baseline `v0.0.1-governance`.
- Prepare hooks for optical and free-space communication (Phase 2 tests).

## Scope
- ✅ Software-only integration
- ❌ No hardware connectors yet (reserved for Phase 3)
- 🧠 Prepares telemetry sync structure for later modules
