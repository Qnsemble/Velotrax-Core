# Velotrax Core Ontology
Ontological orchestration and simulation framework under the Qnsemble architecture.

## Overview
Velotrax Core defines distributed orchestration protocols (StatePacks, Lineage Logs, and Integration Manifests).
It serves as the “living ontology” — the conceptual blueprint that evolves dynamically through validated state transitions.

## Components
- Simulation Nodes  
- Lineage Elements  
- Orchestration Controllers  

## Stage
Transitional instantiation stage — realized through executable modules maintaining internal referential integrity.
